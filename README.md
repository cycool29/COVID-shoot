# shooting-game

A game build with Python using [pygame](https://pygame.org) module to shoot COVID with sanitizer, still working.

## Usage

Haven't done yet. Update everyday.

### Prerequisites

To run, you will need [pygame](https://pygame.org) module. To install, run:
``` 
pip3 install pygame 
```
### Installation and Run

Now clone the repo, and launch `main.py`.
```
git clone https://github.com/cycool29/shooting-game
cd shooting-game
python3 ./main.py
```

There are three options: `Play`, `Help` and `Quit`

After clicking `Play`, it will popup a 3 secs countdown and the game will start!

- **To shoot** -> press <kbd>SPACE</kbd>
- **To move the sanitizer** -> press <kbd>RIGHT</kbd> key and <kbd>LEFT</kbd> key
